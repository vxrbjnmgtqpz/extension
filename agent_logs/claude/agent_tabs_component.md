# AgentTabs Component Log

**Timestamp:** 2025-05-23T00:00:00Z

## Implementation Notes

- Created `AgentTabs.tsx` as a modular React component
- Maintains internal state for `activeAgent` (default: chatgpt)
- Renders a horizontal row of 3 agent buttons (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot)
- Each tab includes an emoji, label, and tooltip for clarity
- Highlights the active agent and provides hover styles
- Exports selected agent via props or context (future-proofed)
- No logging, input, or routing logic included (per requirements)
- Added clear TODO for future animation/logging of tab switches
- Created `index.ts` for clean imports

## TODOs

- [ ] Animate or log tab switches if required in future
- [ ] Integrate with app-level state/context for agent selection

## Status

AgentTabs component complete. Ready for next directive or ChatRouter prototype.
