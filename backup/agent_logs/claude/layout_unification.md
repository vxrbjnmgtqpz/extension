# Layout Unification Log

**Timestamp:** 2025-05-23T00:00:00Z

## Implementation Notes

- Unified AgentTabs, ChatRouter, and MessageComposer into a single UI shell in `main.tsx`
- Used React `useState` to track and pass `activeAgent` to all components
- Layout: flex column, min-h-screen, responsive
  - AgentTabs at top, visually separated with border and shadow
  - ChatRouter in center, scrollable and grows to fill space
  - MessageComposer fixed at bottom, with border and padding
- All components receive `activeAgent` as prop for context
- Layout matches provided wireframe and is consistent with Tailwind best practices

## Responsiveness

- Layout adapts to screen height (min-h-screen)
- ChatRouter scrolls independently, MessageComposer remains visible
- Padding and spacing ensure usability on various screen sizes

## TODOs

- [ ] Add theming (dark mode, color customization)
- [ ] Persist activeAgent selection across reloads (localStorage or context)
- [ ] Further polish for mobile responsiveness

## Status

Layout unification complete. Ready for polish or log integration.
