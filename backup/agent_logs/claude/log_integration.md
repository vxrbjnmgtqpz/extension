# Log Integration Log

**Timestamp:** 2025-05-23T00:00:00Z

## Implementation Notes

- Set up per-agent log files in `agent_logs/<agent>/log.json` (array of message objects)
- Created `readLog.ts` utility to load logs for each agent (mocked with imports)
- Created `writeLog.ts` utility to append messages to in-memory log arrays (simulates file write)
- Updated `ChatRouter` to read messages from live log via `readAgentLog`
- Updated `MessageComposer` to append new messages to the log via `writeAgentLog` and trigger UI update
- Used `getTimestamp` for ISO timestamps on new messages
- UI updates in real time as messages are sent

## Limitations

- No persistent file writing yet (in-memory only)
- No log file watching or real-time sync between tabs/windows

## TODOs

- [ ] Implement persistent log writing (fs.writeFile or API)
- [ ] Add log file watching for real-time updates
- [ ] Support log metadata (file, type, etc) if needed

## Status

Log integration complete. Ready for file persistence, memory injection, or assistant queue design.
