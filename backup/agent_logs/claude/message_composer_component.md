# MessageComposer Component Log

**Timestamp:** 2025-05-23T00:00:00Z

## Implementation Notes

- Created `MessageComposer.tsx` as a multiline input bar for sending messages to the selected agent
- Accepts `activeAgent` prop to direct messages
- Maintains internal state for `inputText`
- Auto-expanding textarea (up to 5 lines)
- Handles Enter (send) and Shift+Enter (newline)
- Submit button with send icon, disabled if input is empty
- On submit: logs message to console in log entry format, clears input
- TODO: Add logic to write to mockLog\_<agent>.json or real log file in future
- Layout and styling consistent with rest of UI (Tailwind)
- Created `index.ts` for clean imports

## TODOs

- [ ] Write sent messages to mockLog\_<agent>.json or real log file
- [ ] Integrate with live log routing and app-level state

## Status

MessageComposer component complete. Ready for layout polish, or live log routing.
