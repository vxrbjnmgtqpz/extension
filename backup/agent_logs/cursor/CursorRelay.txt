_**User**_

The section title cards that are spawnable, first of all center the title letters
I need to add the following conventions, I need capitalizations to not be important:

If user starts typing "A" Assume Intro Verse Chorus etc right down the line, where abab would = intro verse intro verse 

If user starrts entering "ivc" assume Intro, Verse, Chorus
and that type of convention
